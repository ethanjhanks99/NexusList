# NexusList

## Description

This app is a personal project that I am making for the purpose of self hosting on a home lab. The main goal is to make a to-do list app that I would actually use consistently. 

## Status

This app is still under early development. Currently, my focus is on building the API.

## Technologies Used

The backend will be built with Java Spring, with PostgreSQL as a database service. The front end will use React with Vite. I have not settled on a CSS framework.
